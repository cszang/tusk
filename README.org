  Make working with gridded climate data in R a little easier. 

** Purpose
   Extract point-specific climate data from some commonly used gridded
   climate data sets.

** Data sets
   The data sets have to be downloaded by the user and saved locally
   as netCDF files. Currently, these data sets are supported:
   - [[http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/view/badc.nerc.ac.uk__ATOM__ACTIVITY_3ec0d1c6-4616-11e2-89a3-00163e251233][CRU TS 3.20]]
   - [[http://digital.csic.es/handle/10261/72264][SPEIbase v.2.2]]
   - [[http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/cas/catalog/climind/pdsi.html][scPDSI from Dai 2011a and 2011b]]

** Installation

#+begin_src R
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github("tusk", "znag")
#+end_src

** Usage
   See =?interpol_four= for details.

** Todo

   - support netCDF version 4
   - additional data sets?
